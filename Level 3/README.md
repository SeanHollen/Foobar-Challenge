**Summary**

I got 168 hours (7 days) for each of 3 problems. In order received:

*the-greatest-staircase-of-them-all*: Dynamic Programming question
*fuel-ingestion-perfection*: Markov Chain problem
*doomsday-fuel*: Arithmetic Operations and Efficient Recursion (at least I used recursion) problem 

**Notes**

I got the staircase question first. I finished it very quickly because I had done a similar problem before. 

I got doomsday-fuel next. I have to admit it kinda took the wind out of me. It took me a full day between requesting the challenge and completion, of which I must have spent 8 hours directly on the problem. One thing I am proud of is that I came up with the algorithm on my own from thinking about it, not by googling. I ran into my "nightmare scenario": some of the hidden test cases pass, but not all of them, and I don't know what's making it fail. I fixed it by running my own test cases, and a little bit of googling on what problems others have experienced. 

I got fuel ingestion next. It seems to be checking whether you can make arithametic/quick-string-editing functions, and do recursion efficiently. I'm actually not sure of a clean way to solve it without recursion. The problem was much easier than doomsday-fuel, though.

**Summary**

I got 168 hours (7 days) for each of 2 problems. In order received:

*elevator-maintainance*: Sorting problem

*en-route-salute*: simple problem with a "trick" to make it linear-time

**Notes**

If I recall correctly, I got en-route-salute first, the elevator-maintainance. Both I finished pretty quickly. 

I got the referral link after this level, no I'm not posting it here.

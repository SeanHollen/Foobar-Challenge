Foobar Challenge is Google's secret coding challenge. They at one point used it for recruiting, but I don't know if that's still true. Who knows, I might have a recruiter hit me up later about this. But it's been a few months since I finished it, and Google's going through a hiring feeze. 

I got the foobar link by searching circa 2017. I didn't actually start the challenge until 2022.

The time constraints were different than older versions. I get a full week for each problem in levels 1-3, which is different than previous versions.

Don't plagiarize my answers. They probably have some sort of filter to screen out duplicate solutions, so not only are you removing your chances. If you must, just get the general idea from my answers and re-write them.

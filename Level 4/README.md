**Summary**

I got 360 hours (15 days) to complete each of 2 problems. In order received: 

*escape-pods*: Graph Theory Maximum Flow problem

*running-with-bunnies*: Graph Theory Search/Optimization problem

**Notes**

I got escape-pods first. Wow! It was intimidating. But... actually not as bad as I thought it would be. The first big epiphany was merging entrances and exits. Then I vaguely remembered from my college algorithms class that there was an algorithm reducible from this. The Google search engine directed me to Ford-Fuckerson, it was all just implementation from there.

Then I got running-with-bunnies. Before coding, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to solve it, which was pretty fun. I don't know if my solution is optimal, or even over-optimization (oh well, it works). The coding itself came pretty naturally. Tests passed without much of a hassle. 

After completing Level 4 I got another referral link.

**Summary**

I got 528 hours (22 days) to complete 1 problem:

*expanding-nebula*: Cellular Autonoma problem with boolean logic

**Notes**

I got expanding-nebula. Thank God! To be honest, I looked up what some of the level 5 questions were before requesting. I'm glad I didn't get Disorderly Escape - that looks hellish. Expanding Nebula is much more manageable.
